"""Signal-driven wait mode for ``coarse-review --attach <log>``.

Extracted from ``coarse.cli_review`` in the refactor that followed the
initial ``--attach`` landing. The launcher half (``--detach``, the
pipeline invocation, handoff fetching) stays in ``cli_review``; the
watcher half (pidfile r/w, PID liveness, log tail loop with
heartbeats, completion markers, exit-code resolution) lives here.

The split is cleanly one-way: this module has zero imports from any
other ``coarse.*`` submodule. It's pure stdlib (os, subprocess, sys,
time, pathlib, atexit). That makes it safe for ``cli_review`` to
import from at module load time without introducing a circular
dependency, and it means the watcher is trivially unit-testable
without touching the pipeline.

**Public API** (imported by ``cli_review``):

- ``pidfile_for_log(log_path)`` — canonical ``<log>.pid`` path scheme
- ``write_pidfile(pidfile, pid)`` — atomic 0600 write used by the launcher
- ``remove_pidfile(pidfile)`` — best-effort cleanup
- ``read_pidfile(pidfile)`` — parse ``<pid>\\n``, return ``None`` on bad/missing
- ``is_pid_alive(pid)`` — portable liveness check with zombie guard
- ``register_pidfile_cleanup(log_file)`` — atexit hook for detached child
- ``run_attach(log_file, *, timeout_seconds)`` — main watcher loop
- ``handle_watcher_interrupt(log_file)`` — prints re-attach hint, returns 130
- ``ATTACH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` — argparse default for --attach-timeout

Timing knobs (``_ATTACH_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS``, ``_ATTACH_PID_POLL_SECONDS``,
``_ATTACH_PIDFILE_GRACE_SECONDS``, ``_ATTACH_READ_CHUNK``,
``_ATTACH_SUCCESS_MARKERS``, ``_ATTACH_FAILURE_MARKERS``) stay
module-private — tests monkeypatch them via
``cli_attach._ATTACH_FOO``, which works fine on underscore-prefixed
module attributes.

    signal 0 raises `OSError: [WinError 87] The parameter is

    On Windows, delegates to ``_windows_pid_alive`` (OpenProcess +
    GetExitCodeProcess) because ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` is not supported
    by the Windows Python runtime — see that helper's docstring.
    The PID-recycling and zombie guards below are POSIX-only (they
    shell out to ``ps``), so Windows callers accept a slightly
    weaker guarantee: the watcher trusts the OS kernel's view of
    process existence, with no command-line fingerprint check. In
    practice this is fine because the coarse-review detached worker
    is the only thing writing to the log path, and PID recycling
    across runs is rare on the short timescale of a review.

    On POSIX:

    ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` sends signal 0 — no-op permission check that
    returns normally if the PID exists, ``ProcessLookupError`` if
    it's gone, and ``PermissionError`` if the PID exists but belongs
    to another user (treated as 'alive' — someone is running there).

    **Zombie guard**: on POSIX, ``kill -0`` returns success for a
    zombie (reaped-state) process because the entry still exists in
    the process table until the parent calls ``wait()``. In
    production the detached worker is orphaned to init at launch
    time so init reaps immediately — no zombies — but in pytest the
    test process IS the parent of the fake worker and sees a zombie
    for the whole test. Probe ``ps -o state=`` for a Z state so the
    watcher correctly reports dead in both environments.

    **PID recycling guard**: after all the above returns 'alive', we
    additionally verify via ``_pid_looks_like_coarse_review`` that
    the command line at that PID looks like a coarse-review worker.
    This closes the stale-pidfile-after-hard-crash failure mode
    spelled out in ``_pid_looks_like_coarse_review``'s docstring.

    The ``ps`` probes add ~2ms per poll in the hot path, which is

    """Watch a detached coarse-review run and block until it exits.

    Replaces the per-poll ``tail -20`` loop coding agents run during a
    handoff wait. The design goal is: **one agent-visible Bash call
    for the whole wait**, with incremental stdout so the Bash tool
    sees activity and doesn't flag the command as hung.

    Mechanics:

    1. Resolve the pidfile at ``<log>.pid``. Wait up to
       ``_ATTACH_PIDFILE_GRACE_SECONDS`` for it to appear (covers the
       launcher/watcher race when the agent chains ``--detach`` and
       ``--attach`` as back-to-back Bash calls).
    2. Read + parse the PID.
    3. Open the log file from offset 0 and stream new bytes to stdout
       as they appear. Every ``_ATTACH_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`` of
       log-file idleness, emit a ``[attach] pid=<N> elapsed=<mm:ss>
       — waiting…`` heartbeat line so the Bash tool's
       activity-detection doesn't kill us.
    4. Every ``_ATTACH_PID_POLL_SECONDS``, check that the review
       process is still alive via ``os.kill(pid, 0)``. Once it exits,
       drain any remaining log bytes and return.
    5. Exit codes:

       - ``0`` — log contains at least one of the success markers
         (``REVIEW COMPLETE`` / ``PUBLISHED TO COARSE WEB``) and no
         failure marker.
       - ``1`` — log contains a failure marker
         (``ERROR: pipeline failed`` / ``WEB CALLBACK FAILED``).
         Failure wins over success if both are present.
       - ``2`` — PID is gone but no marker was seen. Ambiguous
         outcome — the worker probably crashed silently.
       - ``3`` — pidfile missing or malformed after the grace window,
         or the log file never appeared. Caller error (``--attach``
         was pointed at the wrong log).
       - ``124`` — exceeded ``timeout_seconds``. Matches the
         ``timeout(1)`` convention so shells can special-case it.

    The watcher is **passive**: it never signals the detached process.
    If the user kills ``--attach`` (Ctrl+C, Bash tool timeout), the
    detached worker keeps running and can be re-attached from a
    fresh invocation. This is the whole point of decoupling the
    launcher from the watcher.
